# Implementing Kerberos authentication

****We will need some applications and services****

###  Client 

> - Client application 

### Key Distribution Center (KDC)
>- Authentication Service (AS)
>- Ticket Granting Server (TGS)

### Services

>- Service Application to authenticate to

### Administrtion

>- A database to store users and their secrets
>- An application to add new users
>- An application to delete users

## Administration

So let's start with createPrincipal.py which will create a user and derive the secret key from the password and store it in a database. 

**note: as this is a prototype we'll use a simple .json file instead of a database**

We'll use bcrypt for deriving the secret key by taking the user's password and adding a salt which is the kdc realm + username.

After that we will write the username, secret, creation timestamp and validity timestamp to the .json file.

## AS
To create an Authentication service we will need to understand what it does

When the authentication service recieves data from the client which is 

```
username/id : value
service-requested: value
Timestamp: value
Requested lifetime: value (we will remove this one as we don't need the user to decide the lifetime of a ticket)
```

it will look in its database for that user and respond with two messages

The first is a message encrypted with the user's secret key, which contains 

```
TGS Name: value 
Timestamp: value
Lifetime for TGT: value
TGS session key: value 
```


**note: the principal name of the TGS. example: krbtgt/REALM@REALM. the first realm is the target realm and the second indicates which realm this principal krbtgt/realm belongs to.**

The second message is called TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) which is encrypted with the TGS's secret key and contains

```
Username/Id: value
TGS Name: value
Timestamp: value
User Ip Addresses
Lifetime for TGT
TGS session key
```
The client decrypts the first message with his hash(password + username@realm) and gets the TGS Session Key.
Then the user generates two messages

First is a plaintext message that contains
```
Service Principal name: value
Requested Lifetime for the ticket: value
```
The second message is the User Authenticator which is encrypted with the TGS Session key and which contains
```
Username/ID: value
Timestamp: value
```
These three messages are sent to the TGS and thus the role of the Authentiaction Service is complete:D

# TGS

Now we're moving on to the TGS (Ticket Granting Server)

When the TGS recieves the three messages sent by the client, it first looks at the plaintext message which contains
```
Service principal name: value
Requested lifetime for TGT: value
```
After that it looks at the service db and checks wether the service actually exists. 
If it does, it decrypts the TGT, gets the TGS session key, and decrypts the User Authenticator message. 
Once that is complete it starts validating the messages ensuring that the username/ID's are the same the specified IP in the Ticket is the same as the source ip of the packet it recieved and the timestamps (kerberos usualy tolerates up to two minutes difference in timestamps.)
If all that checks out it generates two messages
The first one is encrypted with the TGS session key which contains
```
service principal name: value
timestamp: value
service session key: value
```
And the second is encrypted with the service's secret key which contains
```
Username/Id: value
Service principal name: value
timestamp: value
user ip address: value 
lifetime for the ticket: value
service session key: value
```

When the client recieves this it decrypts the first message and gets the service session key 
Then it generates another User Authentication message which is encrypted with the service session key and contains
```
Username/ID: value
Timestamp: value
```
The client sends the Service Ticket and the User Authentication messages to the service.

# Service

The service gets the Service Ticket and the User Authentication messages and decrypts the Service Ticket with its secret key, gets the service session key and decrypts the User Authentication message.
It does validation on the messages, and if it's successful it generates a service authentication message which is encrypted by the service session key and contains
```
service principal name: value
timestamp: value
```
and then sends the service authentication message to the client.

the client decrypts the message validates the timestamp and the service principal name, if successful the client and the service have successfully completed the krberos authentication and now have a shared symetric key with which they can communicate securely over an insecure network.

### Some left over questions

>**How are keys generated by the AS and the TGS**

The Authentication Service generates the TGS session key by generating a large totally random number and using that as the TGS session key
example:

```
import os
tgs_session_key = os.urandom(32)
```
The Service session key generated by the TGS works the same way:D
